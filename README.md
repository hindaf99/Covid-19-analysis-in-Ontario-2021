Hinda and Rachel

## Project Description
We want to take the COVID-19 cases data from all cases in Ontario and find trends within it.
We will analyze trends / answer questions about
- Gender
- Age
- Geographic Location
- Date of Infection
- Case Outcomes
- Case Acquisition


# Research Questions
- Which gender is most likely to get COVID?
- Which age group is most likely to get COVID?
- How many positive cases in each city?
- Which month and day had the most COVID cases?
- What is the average number of cases of COVID per month?
- How many people died from COVID? 
- How many people died from COVID in each city?
- What was the most common way that people got COVID? 
- How many cases were the result of an outbreak?
